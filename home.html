   <p> Hand-over-hand (also known as 'hands-on signing'): The receiver's hand(s) are 
    placed lightly upon the back of the hands of the signer to read the signs through 
    touch and movement. <br/>The sign language used in hand-over-hand signing is often a slightly 
    modified version of the local sign language; this is especially the case when used by people
     who have learned to read sign visually before losing their vision as with Usher syndrome. The 
     sign language used may also be a manually coded version of the local oral language 
    (such as Signed English), or a mid-way point between the two known as contact signing.
